AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation,
articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs.
AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF,
EPUB, man page.

AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax
and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.
