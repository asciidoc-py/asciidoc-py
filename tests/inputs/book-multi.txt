Multi-Part Book Title Goes Here
===============================
Author's Name
v1.0, 2003-12
:doctype: book


[dedication]
Example Dedication
==================
The optional dedication goes here.

This document is an AsciiDoc multi-part book skeleton containing
briefly annotated element placeholders plus a couple of example index
entries and footnotes. Books are normally used to generate DocBook
markup and the preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and index
section titles are significant ('specialsections').

NOTE: Multi-part books differ from all other AsciiDoc document formats
in that top level sections (dedication, preface, book parts,
appendices, bibliography, glossary, index) must be level zero headings
(not level one).


[preface]
Example Preface
================
The optional book preface goes here at section level zero.

Preface Sub-section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: Preface and appendix subsections start out of sequence at level
2 (level 1 is skipped). This only applies to multi-part book
documents.



The First Part of the Book
==========================

The First Chapter
-----------------
Chapters can be grouped by preceding them with a level 0 Book Part
title.

Book chapters are at level 1 and can contain sub-sections nested up to
three deep.
footnote:[An example footnote.]
indexterm:[Example index entry]

It's also worth noting that a book part can have it's own preface,
bibliography, glossary and index. Chapters can have their own
bibliography, glossary and index.

And now for something completely different: ((monkeys)), lions and
tigers (Bengal and Siberian) using the alternative syntax index
entries.
(((Big cats,Lions)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Bengal Tiger)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Siberian Tiger)))
Note that multi-entry terms generate separate index entries.

Here are a couple of image examples: an image:images/smallnew.png[]
example inline image followed by an example block image:

.Tiger block image
image::images/tiger.png[Tiger image]

Followed by an example table:
